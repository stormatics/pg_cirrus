# pg_cirrus
The name **cirrus** comes from the cirrus cloud, a thin and wispy cloud that forms at high altitudes.

pg_cirrus is a solution for setting up a 3-node highly available PostgreSQL cluster on Linux operating systems. Currently, it only supports Ubuntu, however support for other Linux flavors is on the roadmap

Main technologies used are PostgreSQL and Ansible.

The objective of this project is to configure a highly available 3-node cluster in easiest possible way.
